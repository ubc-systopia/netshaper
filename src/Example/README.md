## MinesVPN prototype Implementation
Here, we implement a prototype of MinesVPN application for two middleboxes, where each middlebox can provide service for multiple clients. 
We refer to the middlebox at the client-side as the Peer 1. Similarly, the middlebox at the server-side is Peer 2.
We provide documentation of each peer in their corresponding directories.
